### Base on: https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Canon_Characters\n\nCome up with a Straw Crew with CrewAI in pytohn

```txt
The user wants to create a CrewAI crew in Python based on the One Piece Straw Hat Pirates.
I need to:

Find information about CrewAI and how to create a crew with it.
Get the list of Straw Hat Pirates from the provided URL.
Create a CrewAI crew in Python, assigning roles based on the Straw Hat Pirates.
Tool Usage Plan:

Search: Use Google Search to find information about CrewAI and how to create a crew.
Browse: Use the Browse tool to get the list of Straw Hat Pirates from the provided URL.
Python Code: Write Python code to create a CrewAI crew based on the information gathered.
Step 1: Search for CrewAI information
Query: CrewAI create crew python

Step 2: Browse the provided URL
URL: https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_Canon_Characters
Query: List of Straw Hat Pirates from the webpage

Step 3: Python Code generation (after gathering information)
Based on the information from the webpage and CrewAI documentation, I will write Python code to define agents and create a crew.

The search results provide information on how to install and set up CrewAI, create a new project, and run a crew. It seems like CrewAI can be set up using command-line interface (CLI) and Python.

Now I need to browse the One Piece Fandom page to get the list of Straw Hat Pirates.
